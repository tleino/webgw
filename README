webgw - Web proxy that enforces whitelisting policy

Webgw is a non-caching http/https proxy server which only lets connections
to whitelisted hosts pass.

As connection attempts are made, webgw holds the connections, until the
user unblocks the connection by whitelisting the host. This way a whitelist
can be built simply by browsing the Web.

Webgw is practically created for the most paranoid Web users, as it makes
using the Web a little cumbersome, unless one browses only the same sites
over and over again.
